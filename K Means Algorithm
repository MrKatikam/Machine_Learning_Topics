ML Algorithms are generally broken down into two types - supervised and unsupervised. 

K-Means clustering is one of the unsupervised algorithms because the input data does not have a labeled response.

Clustering : It is the process of grouping data points into different sets based on their degree of similarity.
    
    Types of Clustering:
        1. Hierarchical Clustering:
                It builds a hierarchy of clusters based on the similarity between data points. 
                It can be divided into two categories: 
                             a. Agglomerative clustering (bottom-up) 
                             b. Divisive Clustering (top-down)
        2. Partitioning Clustering:
                 a. K-Means clustering :
                      This method groups data points into K clusters based on their similarity.
                      It works by iteratively assigning each data point to the closest cluster center and 
                      updating the cluster centers based on the mean of the points in the cluster.
                 b. Fuzzy C-Means clustering :
